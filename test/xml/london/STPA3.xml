                <p>There were six access points into the enclosure: <ref target="mol:FLEE2">Ludgate Street</ref>; <ref target="mol:STPA16">Paul’s Alley</ref> from

                    and was a chain or barrier which was put across the carriage way during the hours of public worship to stop people entering the churchyard whilst worship was in progress.</p>  
                <p>The new enclosure included the land where the mayor and citizens had once held court. They called this assembly the <soCalled>Folkmoot,</soCalled> a word derived from the old
                    English <foreign xml:lang="ang">folcgemōt</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="ang">folc</foreign>, meaning <soCalled>folk,</soCalled> and <foreign xml:lang="ang">gemót</foreign>,

                    Augustine meant that people no longer had free access and egress. Thornbury refers to a number of buildings that were situated within the churchyard, including the Bishop’s palace,
                    a slaughter-house, and a brewery (<ref type="bibl" target="mol:THOR8">Thornbury</ref>). Slaughter-houses were normally housed outside of the city, and animals were frequently killed 
                    in the open air. This would have meant considerable mess and the smell of blood, the buzzing of flies, and the noises of distressed animals.  Many of these properties were sold or
                    leased as shops under <name ref="mol:HENR1">Henry VIII</name>’s dissolution of the monasteries. There was a charnel house in the churchyard, but this was pulled down in 
                    <date datingMethod="mol:julianSic" calendar="mol:julianSic" when-custom="1549">1549</date>, and the bones were moved to <ref target="mol:FINS2">Finsbury Field</ref>. According

                    tendency for booksellers and printers to move into the churchyard. In the east of the churchyard was <ref target="mol:STPA4">St. Paul’s School</ref>, which was built in

                    The pulpit, along with the <soCalled>Folkmoot,</soCalled> made <ref target="mol:STPA3">St. Paul’s Churchyard</ref> a meeting place for people and a centre for public gathering.

                        hailing the dawn of a golden age in which everything that has fallen will rise again. At the beginning of the passage, <name ref="mol:ELIZ1">Elizabeth</name>’s reception is 
                        described: she <quote>was of the people receiued merueylous entierly, as appeared by thassemblie, prayers, wisshes, welcomminges, cryes, tender woordes, and all other signes,

                                Passage</title> sig. A.ii.r.</ref>). Despite the relative lack of detail in the performance and the reception of the oration in <ref target="mol:STPA3">St. Paul’s
                                    Churchyard</ref>, it is reasonable to assume that the same sort of response awaited her there. The churchyard was a traditional place of gathering, and would
                        have been full of people anxious to get a glimpse of their sovereign. At several points, <title level="m">The Queen’s Majesty’s Passage</title> refers to the difficulty 
                        <name ref="mol:ELIZ1">Elizabeth</name> had in hearing the pageants and orations, asking <quote>what that pageant was ere that she came to it</quote> at
                        <ref target="mol:CORN2">Cornhill</ref>, <quote>because shee feared for the peoples noyse, that she should not here the child which did expounde the same</quote>

                         The loudest noises of the soundscape would have been bells and canons, with people,
                        animals, the weather, and so forth providing background noise (<ref type="bibl" target="mol:SMIT30">Smith 49</ref>). There would have been a large crowd in the
                        churchyard, and the architecture of the place itself would have influenced the sort of sound that they created since sound was absorbed, reflected, and dispersed 
                        according to the physical characteristics of the cathedral, the other buildings, and the people themselves. Stone would have deflected sound, and plaster-over-lathe would have been reverberant, aiding the oration’s audibility (<ref type="bibl" target="mol:SMIT30">Smith 180</ref>). However, the orator would still have had to compete with the absorbing factor of the people and the background noise created by the people and animals that filled the churchyard.</p>
                <p>Against a soundscape composed of pre-industrial noises, the sounds from other elements of the passage would have been audible to the people congregated in the churchyard
                    that day.  At <ref target="mol:STAN17">The Standard</ref> in <ref target="mol:CHEA2">Cheap</ref> <quote>was placed a noyse of Trumpettes</quote>, and at the door to
                    <ref target="mol:STPE6">St. Peter’s</ref> <quote>stode the waites of the citie, which did geue a pleasant noyse with theyr instrumentes as the Quenes maiestie did 
                        passe by</quote> (<ref target="mol:QMPS1" type="mol:bibl"><title level="a">The Queen’s Majesty’s Passage</title> sig. C.ii.v.</ref>). Depending on the wind direction, it is
                    entirely possible that these noises would have been audible in <ref target="mol:STPA3">St. Paul’s Churchyard</ref>, especially the trumpets with their strident,
                    penetrating timbre. At <ref target="mol:LUDG1">Ludgate</ref>, <name ref="mol:ELIZ1">Elizabeth</name> was <quote>receiued with a noyse of instruments</quote>, and 
                    again, this was likely to have been audible to the people congregated in the churchyard or by those following the pageant towards it. The description of a <quote>noyse 
                        of instruments</quote> suggests that louder instruments such as sackbuts and cornetts were chosen, because they were more likely to be heard at distance and above ambient noise.</p>

                    <p>Book publishing and selling was a feature of the churchyard from the <date datingMethod="mol:julianSic" calendar="mol:julianSic" notBefore-custom="1300">14th century</date>, and this increased when the old buildings were sold off by <name ref="mol:HENR1">Henry VIII</name>. It was a thriving, bustling place, with numerous businesses publishing and selling a range of texts.
